Edit                                     
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman-sayedd/Numerical-Analysis-Problem-Solver-System.git                           
cd numerical-analysis-solver                     
 
2️⃣ Open the project in Visual Studio                                   
Ensure .NET Framework is installed.                         
Open the .sln file.
                     
3️⃣ Run the application:
Press F5 or click Start in Visual Studio.
                           
🛠️ Practice & Extend the System                                  
The project includes three empty Windows Forms (Gauss Elimination, LU Decomposition, and Cramer's Rule). These are left intentionally blank so you can practice implementing these numerical methods after understanding how the other forms were built.
